# JCarrierPigeon

## The library

**JCarrierPigeon** is a small library written in Java that provides notification features to any `javax.swing.JFrame` or `javax.swing.JWindow` object. It currently supports multiple notifications through a notification queue manager. In order to achieve a greater effect, it's highly recommended to remove the window border of the provided `javax.swing.JFrame`. You don't need to worry about removing borders if you are using `javax.swing.JWindow`, since it has no borders at all.
